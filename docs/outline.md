All content reflects the presenter’s independent views and does not represent the official position of any institution or regulatory agency.

---

**SLIDE 3: Learning Objectives**  
By the end of this session, you should be able to:  

- Understand key external regulations affecting LIS and IMS.  
- Recognize the role of HIPAA, FDA, and internal validation in laboratory systems.  
- Comprehend how regulations shape software and organizational design.  
- Explore the informatician’s role in digital transformation.  
- Appreciate the growing importance of enterprise analytics.

---

**SLIDE 4: Why It Matters**  

- Pathology is increasingly digital.  
- Systems like LIS and IMS are core to your workflow.  
- Regulation shapes what tools we can use, how we use them, and how fast we can change.  
- YOU are the next generation of pathologists: be informed, be involved.

---

**SLIDE 5: Key External Regulations**  

- HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)  
  - Patient privacy and data security
- CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments)  
  - Governs lab testing standards
- FDA (Food and Drug Administration)  
  - Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)
- CAP and Joint Commission  
  - Accreditation and compliance
- NIST Guidelines: cybersecurity best practices for software, even if not lab-specific
- Cybersecurity Insurance: increasingly sets technical requirements for covered institutions
- Internal Compliance Forces: organizational policies often influenced by insurers, consultants, and legal advisors

---

**SLIDE 6: HIPAA & Data Protection**  

- What HIPAA covers: PHI, access control, audit trails
- Relevance to LIS/IMS: patient data, annotations, sign-outs
- Encryption, secure storage, and transmission
- Case study: breach example and its impact

---

**SLIDE 7: CLIA & Laboratory Oversight**  

- Role in ensuring test accuracy and reproducibility
- LIS as part of a compliant testing environment
- Pre-analytic, analytic, post-analytic phases
- Validation of informatics tools for lab use

---

**SLIDE 8: FDA and Software Regulation**  

- SaMD and the FDA: what qualifies?
- IMS increasingly under scrutiny
- LDTs (Laboratory Developed Tests) vs FDA-cleared tests
- Risk-based approach: Class I-III software
- Recent examples (e.g., AI-assisted diagnosis)

---

**SLIDE 9: Internal Validation: What, When, Why**  

- Internal validation vs. vendor claims
- Documentation and reproducibility
- Human factors & usability validation
- Example: validation of a new image viewer or LIS module

---

**SLIDE 10: Case Example: Validation Workflow**  

- Step-by-step internal validation process
- Tools: test case libraries, error logging, stakeholder sign-off
- Outcome: audit trail and approval

---

**SLIDE 11: How Regulations Shape Design**  

- Software architecture: modular, auditable, traceable
- Access control, logging, downtime protocols
- Organizational policies reflect these designs
- Example: user roles in LIS vs. IMS

---

**SLIDE 12: Informaticians as Advocates**  

- Informaticians bridge clinical, regulatory, and technical worlds
- Role in software selection and implementation
- Promoting safe and effective workflows
- Residents can lead: committees, feedback loops

---

**SLIDE 13: Impact of Enterprise Health Care Analytics**  

- From LIS to data lakes
- Pathology's role in system-wide metrics
- Predictive analytics and AI integration
- You are a data source AND a data consumer

---

**SLIDE 14: Organizational Effects of Technology & Regulation**  

- Regulations can stall innovation OR shape safe adoption
- Org structures change to reflect tech use (e.g., Digital Pathology Units)
- Interdisciplinary collaboration: IT, QA, Compliance, Pathology

---

**SLIDE 15: Digital Pathology: Then and Now**  

- Side-by-side diagram: traditional vs digital workflow  
- Highlight advantages: speed, remote access, integrated tools  
- Mention European models with 100% digital workflows

---

**SLIDE 16: AI and Decision Support Systems**  

- Examples: AI for triage, mitosis detection, quality control
- Role of AI as decision support, not decision maker (per regulation)
- Risks: over-reliance, off-label use
- Importance of proper validation and oversight

---

**SLIDE 17: Vision for the Future**  

- Fully integrated digital ecosystem: LIS, IMS, AI, EHR
- Companion diagnostics, personalized medicine support
- Regulatory frameworks as enablers (not just obstacles)
- Your future role in shaping that ecosystem

---

**SLIDE 18: Challenges and Opportunities**  

- Change is hard: training, resistance, cost
- But digital systems allow speed, reproducibility, access
- Residents have unique perspective: embrace, refine, lead

---

**SLIDE 19: Takeaway Messages**  

- Know the regulations: HIPAA, CLIA, FDA
- Think systemically: how design and orgs interconnect
- Be proactive: your voice matters in digital transformation
- The future of pathology is not just digital. It is shaped by YOU.
